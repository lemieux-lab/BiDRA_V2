Pairwise compmarison is performed when the uploaded dataset contains two experiments.

The difference posterior is calculated for each efficiency metrics and represented by histograms. The shift of those histograms from the baseline 0 indicates if the two experiments differentiate for a given efficiency metrics. For each experiment, the probability of having a larger value for a given efficiency metrics compared to the other experiment is indicated in each plot.

The quantile-to-quantile comparisons of the sorted posteriors for each efficiency metrics is also represented. The identity (x = y) diagnonal is also plotted to put the comparison in percepective.
