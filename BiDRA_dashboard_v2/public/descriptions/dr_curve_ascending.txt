Experimental responses are illustrated by black dots. The inferred median dose-reponse curve is shown as a black continuous line. The shaded region is representative of the 95% confidence interval (CI) on the inferred median dose-response curve.
LDR (blue) is indicative of the minimal response, and HDR (green) of the maximal response.
Efficiency metrics' posterior distributions are represented as black histogram: their median response is depicted by a continuous colored line and their 95% CI by a shaded colored region.
Values for the latters two metrics (median and CI bounds) are reported in the assossiated legend.
The Ïƒ posterior is also depicted (pink).
